A: "So Mark. What is your favorite hobby?"
B: "Probably sports."
A: "Anything specific? Or just sports in general."
B: "Most sports. I like basketball, football, baseball, golf, tennis, so I guess most sports."
A: "I like tennis. Did you play for your high school team?"
B: "Yeah. I played on the varsity team starting from my sophomore year. How about you?"
A: "I played my junior and senior year."
B: "What other sports did you play?"
A: "I played volleyball. I would have to say volleyball is my favorite."
B: "What position did you play?"
A: "I was the outside hitter."
B: "That's so cool. I didn't know you were athletic."
A: "I don't know if I would consider myself athletic, but I have fun playing."
B: "I play on a co-ed volleyball team every Tuesdays. We're always looking for more girls to play on our team. Would you be interested?"
A: "Yeah. It sounds fun. Just call me anytime you need a player."
B: "That's great. Since we are on the topic of sports, what sport do you like to watch on television?"
A: "I never got into watching sports on TV. So I really don't know."
B: "Not even the Super bowl?"
A: "Only when the group of people I'm with is watching it. I just never had interest in TV that much."
B: "Well, I like following the Mariners. They're pretty good."
A: "I like to go watch them play. It's fun when you are actually there."
B: "A bunch of us are going to watch them play this June. Do you want to join us?"
A: "Yeah. I'll go. I like the new stadium. It's pretty cool."
B: "Ok. I'll make sure to get you a ticket as well."
