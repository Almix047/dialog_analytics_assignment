A: "Yo Matt. How goes it man?"
B: "Pretty good. What have you been up to?"
A: "You know that chick in psychology class?"
B: "Yeah. You only talk about her every other day."
A: "I can't get her out of my mind. She is damn fine."
B: "Why don't you go talk to her then?"
A: "I think she is out of my league."
B: "Chicken. Somebody is only out of your league if you think so. What do you see in her anyway? She is a little chubby dude."
A: "She is not. She has a nice figure. And she has such a pretty face."
B: "Whatever. If you think so."
A: "You like skinny girls or something?"
B: "I like normal girls without any flab hanging out."
A: "Now you're exaggerating you freak."
B: "Seriously, I like a girl who is fit and likes to exercise."
A: "How about personality?"
B: "It doesn't matter until you are thinking about marriage and I'm not thinking about that yet."
A: "Well, I'm looking so I don't care that much about figure. As long as she is nice and sweet."
