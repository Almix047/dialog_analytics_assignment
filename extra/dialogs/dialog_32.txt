O: "Hi. Aren't you in my sociology class?"
B: "I think so. With Professor Robinson right?"
O: "Yeah. I'm Nicole."
B: "I'm George. It's nice to meet you."
O: "How are you liking the class so far?"
B: "I like the subject. I think it's pretty interesting."
O: "Me too. But it's hard to sit in class when the weather is so nice."
B: "Tell me about it. The weather has been so great lately."
O: "So, what year are you?"
B: "I'm a sophomore. How about you?"
O: "I'm a freshman."
B: "Where are you from around here?"
O: "No. I'm from the east. I grew up in New York."
B: "New York? That seems like a fun place."
O: "More like a busy place. Everyone is always on the run over there."
B: "I grew up in San Francisco."
O: "That's not too far from here. Do you like living on the west coast?"
B: "I haven't been to many other places, but the west coast is a great place."
O: "Yeah. I like it too."
B: "Are you ready for the mid term next Friday?"
O: "I'm so behind. I've been going out a lot. I'm having so much fun, but I really need to catch up on my school work."
B: "Where do you usually hang out?"
O: "No where specific. We always do different things."
B: "Have you been to Alcatraz yet?"
O: "Not yet. I want to go though."
B: "I highly recommend it. It's an interesting place to visit."
O: "Maybe you could take me there."
B: "If you get a B or better on your midterm, I'll take you there."
O: "Deal. It was great meeting you. I'll talk to you again tomorrow."
B: "Ok. See you later."
