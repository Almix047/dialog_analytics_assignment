A: "How did you golf on Saturday?"
J: "I did pretty good. I shot a 13."
A: "Not too bad. I thought you were going to break single."
J: "I had a chance. I shot a 4 on the front nine, but the back nine killed me."
A: "What happened?"
J: "My drive was totally off. All of the sudden, I started hooking the ball. I hit two balls OB, and that killed my score right there."
A: "That sucks. You could have broken single if it wasn't for the penalty strokes."
J: "Yeah. I was so frustrated after that hole. But overall, I shot well, so I'm not too disappointed. How about you? How have you been hitting lately?"
A: "I hit great on the range, but when I get on the course, I can't seem to hit the ball right."
J: "That happened to me for the longest time. It just takes time and practice. When you go out on the course more often, that problem will fix itself."
A: "I'm still trying to break 90. I've been hitting in the mid nineties for ever."
J: "How far does your driver go?"
A: "I don't use it that much. I use my 3 wood more. I'm not consistent with the driver to use it."
J: "You gotta keep practicing with it. Eventually you'll get the hang of it."
A: "Yeah. I practice with it on the range, but I'm not making any progress on it."
J: "Let's go to the range together and I'll check out your swing."
A: "That sounds good. Let's go tomorrow night."
J: "Ok. That will give us practice for our round on Wednesday."
A: "I'll meet you there at 6:30."
J: "Ok. See you tomorrow then."
