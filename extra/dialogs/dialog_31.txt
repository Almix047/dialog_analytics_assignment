A: "What are you doing here on the bench? You've been here for an hour."
B: "I'm just thinking about Lucy. I can't get her out of my mind. I think I'm falling in love."
A: "Crazy boy. You barely know her."
B: "It doesn't matter. I like everything about her. I like the way she talks, the way she walks, her hair and her lips. I would give anything to kiss her."
A: "Did you tell her how you feel?"
B: "No way. I'll scare her away."
A: "You won't know until you tell her."
B: "Maybe later. But right now, all I can think about is her legs and her face. She is so beautiful."
A: "You're wasting your time. At least talk to her. You don't have to tell her how you feel."
B: "Yeah. I started talking to her in my Poly Sci class. I try to sit next to her as much as I can."
A: "That's a start. After awhile, you'll find out if she is everything you make her out to be."
B: "It won't matter because I love everything she does."
A: "Dude, you're blind as a bat. You're just infatuated with her."
B: "These feelings are too strong to be infatuation."
A: "We'll see in a couple of weeks. Let's go grab something to eat. You're human aren't you?"
B: "To think of it, I am a little hungry. Ok. Let's go."
