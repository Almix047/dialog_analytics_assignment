D: "Hey Mike. I heard about your break up. You must be devastated."
F: "It's more than I can bear. I don't think I can go on."
D: "Come on Mike. It's not the end of the world."
F: "It's the end of my world. She was everything to me. I loved her so much."
D: "I remember my first break up. I remember it was the hardest thing I ever went through. So I know it must be really tough right now."
F: "Every night, I cry myself to sleep. Can you believe that I actually cry everyday?"
D: "It's normal to cry. You shouldn't feel bad about it. It's the only way to let it out."
F: "How long will I feel like this? How long is the pain going to last?"
D: "It's different for everyone, but it took me four months to get over Jessica."
F: "Four months... I have to live in hell for four months..."
D: "But I'm ok now. I moved on and I'm dating other great people. I know you will be better."
F: "Why do you think she left me?"
D: "I really don't know. Some people change and they want to go in different directions."
F: "But I loved her so much. I loved her more than anything in this world. She was my world."
D: "I know you love her."
F: "I don't think I'll be able to love anyone again."
D: "I thought that too. I thought Jessica was the only person I would ever love. But it changes. It really does. You'll get better and become a stronger person."
F: "I hope so."
