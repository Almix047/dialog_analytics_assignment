A: "Do you like to watch baseball?"
B: "Yeah. I follow the Mariners every year."
A: "I wonder how they will do this year."
B: "I don't know if they have a chance. Did you hear that A-Rod went to the Yankees?"
A: "I know. Their team was too good even before getting Alex."
B: "Yeah. The richest team is usually the best team. They need to put a salary cap to make things fair."
A: "I agree. I don't know why they haven't done so already."
B: "But don't lose hope too soon. The Yankees don't have a good pitching staff this year. They might end up like the Texas Rangers. Great offense, no pitching."
A: "I highly doubt that. Even though they lost Pettite, they still have a decent pitching rotation."
B: "We'll see. I hope the Mariners do well this year."
A: "Me too. Oh, did you buy any tickets this year?"
B: "I got a couple of games with Oakland and Boston, but I couldn't get anything with the Yankees."
A: "Same here. I went in on the second day and all the tickets with the Yankees were already sold out."
B: "There's still plenty of other games though. We should go together one of these days."
A: "Sounds good. Let's plan for late June."
