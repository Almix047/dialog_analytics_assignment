A: "What are you watching?"
B: "A football game. Packers are playing the Chiefs."
A: "I never understood this game."
B: "It's not that hard. If you watch a couple of games, you'll start to understand it."
A: "Do you watch a lot of football?"
B: "I like the Packers, so I watch all their games."
A: "Did you play football before?"
B: "Only in high school. I was too small to play for college."
A: "What position did you play?"
B: "I was the corner back."
A: "Is that the main guy in offense?"
B: "No. That's the quarterback. The corner back is a defensive player covering passing plays and outside running plays."
A: "I see. Do you think it is more fun than baseball?"
B: "It's hard to compare the two because they're so different. I like both baseball and football. How about you? You like baseball a lot?"
A: "Yeah. I'm a big baseball fan."
B: "Baseball is fun, but you should also learn football. I'll explain as we watch."
A: "Cool."
