A: "How are you feeling these days?"
B: "I don't know. A little bored and restless I guess."
A: "Why is that?"
B: "I have so much time on my hands and I have nothing to do."
A: "Why don't you go out and have fun?"
B: "I would like to, but I have to save some money so I can't go out all the time."
A: "That sucks."
B: "After awhile, I start to feel anxious."
A: "Try relaxing and reading a good book. That's always a good way to kill time."
B: "That's true. How about you? How are you these days?"
A: "I'm doing pretty good these days. My kid just finished kindergarten. I'm so proud of him."
B: "That's great to hear. He must be big now. It's been a year since I saw your son."
A: "Yeah. He grew a lot in the last year."
B: "I bet you're very proud of your son."
A: "Yes I am. Thanks."
