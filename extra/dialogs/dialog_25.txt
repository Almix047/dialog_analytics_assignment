A: "What do you think about Matt's new girlfriend?"
B: "Samantha? She's pretty hot. I can't believe she fell for Matt."
A: "I don't seem to have much luck with girls."
B: "Why do you think that is?"
A: "I say the stupidest things around girls. I don't know why I do that?"
B: "It's because you're nervous. Best thing to do is not say a word until you know it's not stupid."
A: "It doesn't work that way. I stop thinking around pretty girls."
B: "I know. You got to date a girl who isn't that pretty then."
A: "What the story of your love life these days?"
B: "It's only been a couple of months that I broke up with Sarah. But I think it's about time to start hunting again."
A: "Who's your type?"
B: "Anybody with a nice body and a pretty face."
A: "How about their personality or their character?"
B: "I'm not thinking about marriage, so those things don't matter."
A: "You're so shallow."
