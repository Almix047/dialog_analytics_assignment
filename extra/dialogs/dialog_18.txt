A: "Do you know when basketball season starts?"
K: "It starts in October. How come?"
A: "I like to keep up with the Lakers."
K: "You keep up with baseball at all?"
A: "Just a little. Not as much as basketball."
K: "Who is your favorite player?"
A: "Probably Kobe Bryant, but he has too many issues right now."
K: "He's a great player, but his recent problem is really affecting his play."
A: "Hope everything turns out ok. Do you play basketball much?"
K: "I usually get into it during the playoffs. I'd rather play than watch."
A: "I like to watch as much as I like to play. Do you play often?"
K: "Every now and then with some friends."
A: "I usually play twice a week at the health club. It's easy to round up 10 guys during the evening time."
K: "That sounds pretty fun. But I'm too out of shape to play full court."
A: "I get tired too, but I figure it's good for my health. And I'm having fun at the same time."
K: "So you think the Lakers will do good this year?"
A: "They better. They got a lot of good players now. If Malone can stay healthy, then I don't see how they can be beat."
K: "I don't know... I think Sacramento has a strong team this year."
A: "True, but I'm pulling for the Lakers all the way. It's going to be a great season."
