K: "Hey honey, where do you think we should go for our honeymoon?"
L: "I always wanted to go to Mexico. Cancun is supposed to be a great place."
K: "That sounds pretty good. But how about the Caribbean?"
L: "That doesn't sound too bad either. Do you know how much it would cost for airfare and hotel?"
K: "If we go for 5 nights, then the total for airfare and hotel would be about one thousand seven hundred dollars. How much would it be to go to Cancun?"
L: "I found a deal for only twelve hundred dollars."
K: "That's a lot cheaper. Let's go to Cancun then."
L: "Really? That sounds great. I picked up a lot of brochures. Let's take a look at all the things we can do."
K: "That reminds me. I better make sure my passport is not expired."
L: "You better make sure. If it's expired, you have to hurry and renew it."
K: "We still have a couple of months. No rush."
L: "What do you want to do in Cancun?"
K: "I want to golf at least one day. And I also want to try surfing. Do they have instructors on the beach?"
L: "Yeah. This brochure shows lesson and equipment rentals and everything. That shouldn't be a problem. I want to try snorkeling."
K: "Do we need to buy snorkeling gear?"
L: "No. We can just rent it there."
K: "Sounds like we're going to have fun."
L: "I know. I can't wait. It's going to be so fun."
