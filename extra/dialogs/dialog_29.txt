A: "What are you afraid of?"
B: "I'm not sure. I used to be scared of a lot of things when I was young, but not anymore."
A: "Are you afraid of death?"
B: "Only if I think about it so much. But death is inevitable, so there is no use thinking about it."
A: "How about horror movies?"
B: "No. I know they're all fake so there is nothing to be afraid of. How about you?"
A: "I get scared pretty easily. I'm actually frightened of bee's."
B: "Really? Why?"
A: "I don't know. I got stung when I was young and ever since, I've always been afraid of them."
B: "What other things are you afraid of?"
A: "Sitting by the camp fire and telling horror stories is very scary."
B: "Wow. You're afraid of many things huh?"
A: "I guess so. Aren't you afraid of something coming out of the bushes?"
B: "It's not going to happen. We probably went camping dozens of times and nothing ever came out of the bushes. What makes you think something will?"
A: "I don't know. I guess I'm terrified at the possibility."
B: "If you were realistic, you probably wouldn't be scared of everything. Maybe you have too much imagination."
A: "I should try to think more realistically. I'll do that."
B: "Good. After awhile, you won't be afraid of so many things."
