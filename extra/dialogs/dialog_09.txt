D: "Hi. My name is Robert."
C: "I'm John. It's nice to meet you."
D: "Do you know what this professor is like?"
C: "I have no idea. This is my first year."
D: "You a freshman? Me too. Where are you from?"
C: "I'm from San Francisco."
D: "I've been there a few times. It's a great city."
C: "Where are you from?"
D: "I grew up in this area all my life."
C: "So you know where all the fun places to hang out right?"
D: "Yeah. The best place is over by the water. They have a lot of clubs and bars."
C: "I drove by that area before. I didn't know it was a college hang-out."
D: "It gets pretty wild over there sometimes. You should go."
C: "Sounds like a good idea. Do you know what you are majoring in yet?"
D: "Not yet. I'm leaning towards business, but that's only if I can't get into computer science. How about you?"
C: "I want to go to med school, so I'll probably end up majoring in biology."
D: "That's cool."
C: "Is the weather this bad all the time in the fall?"
D: "Yap. This is a typical autumn. It gets worse though. At least it's not raining that much."
C: "That sucks."
D: "You'll get used to it. In the meantime, you'll have to watch a lot of movies. Seems like the only thing to do with the bad weather."
C: "Too expensive. Can you believe how much movies cost these days?"
D: "Yeah. It's crazy. It's like 9 bucks a movie. I remember when it was half that."
C: "Unless it's a date, I'm not going to pay that much to watch a movie."
D: "That makes sense."
C: "Oh. The professor is coming. I'll talk to you later."
D: "Aright."
