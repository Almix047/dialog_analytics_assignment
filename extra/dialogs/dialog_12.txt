J: "Where are you guys going for your honeymoon?"
D: "We decided on Cancun, Mexico."
J: "I've been there before. It's a great place."
D: "What did you do there?"
J: "There is so much to do. It's a big tourist place so there is access to everything."
D: "That's good. I'm looking forward to our honeymoon. Especially after all the wedding plans I had to do."
J: "How long are you going for?"
D: "We decided on 6 days. We are leaving on Sunday and returning on Saturday."
J: "That should give you plenty of time. Do you have all your travel plans in order?"
D: "We just booked our flight and got our room. Everything is set."
J: "You're going to have so much fun. I'm so jealous."
D: "When you get married, you'll have your chance."
J: "I need to find a guy first."
D: "Where do you want to go for your honeymoon?"
J: "Since I've been to Mexico and Hawaii before, I want to go to Australia."
D: "That sounds great. It's a little out of our budget so we didn't even consider Australia."
J: "For the price, Cancun is one of the best so don't have any regrets. It is a great place. So do you have a ride to the airport?"
D: "My brother is going to drop us off."
J: "Looks like everything is set. Just make sure to take a camera. I know many people who forgot to take a camera on their honeymoon."
D: "Will do. Thanks."
