A: "Hey Jason. What are you doing this Friday?"
D: "I'm going to go to the driving range cause I'm playing golf on Saturday."
A: "You're golfing without me? What's up with that?"
D: "Sorry man, but we already have a foursome. I'm going with a couple of guys from work."
A: "Where are you playing?"
D: "Washington National. Have you been there yet?"
A: "I've been there a couple of times. It's a great course. You know the Huskies play there right?"
D: "I didn't know that. Is it a hard course?"
A: "It's pretty challenging. But it all depends on which tee you play from."
D: "What are you shooting these days?"
A: "I'm still hovering around a bogey game."
D: "Still better than me. I'm still trying to hit a bogey game. Do you want to hit the driving range with me?"
A: "I can't this Friday. I'm playing basketball with the guys that night."
D: "At night?"
A: "Yeah. We're playing indoors at a school gymnasium."
D: "What's the occasion?"
A: "Just a small league I play on. Nothing special."
D: "I'm too short to play basketball."
A: "You're not that short. Plus, we have a couple of guys who are the same height as you. They're awesome players."
D: "I never got into basketball. It's fun and all, but maybe I'm just not good at it."
A: "It's still great exercise. I get a better workout from basketball than I do from the treadmill."
D: "That's true."
