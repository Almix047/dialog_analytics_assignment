J: "Hey Stephanie. Guess what?"
B: "What?"
J: "Robert asked me to marry him. We're getting married."
B: "Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. So when is the big day?"
J: "We haven't set the date exactly, but it looks like it will be sometime in July."
B: "How did he propose to you?"
J: "On Valentines day, he got me a present. I thought it was an ordinary Valentines day present, but when I opened it, it was this big diamond ring. Right then, he got on his knees and proposed."
B: "That's so neat. So you really got surprised?"
J: "We talked about marriage a little, but I never knew he was serious."
B: "You are going to be busy with wedding plans. But you have several months to prepare for it."
J: "It's going to be pretty hectic for me. So I'm going to need some help. First of all, I was wondering if you would like to be my Maid of Honor."
B: "I would be honored."
J: "So you're going to help me with the planning right?"
B: "Of course. How many brides maids are you going to have?"
J: "Three. So we will have a total of four."
B: "Let me guess. Susan, Tina, and Cindy."
J: "Close. I'm going to have Cindy as the candle lighter. The third brides maid is going to be Lydia. She is a good friend from church."
B: "I know her. She's sweet. I'll make sure we have the best wedding for you."
J: "I hope so. I appreciate your help."
