A: "I'm calling about the available room. Is it still available?"
B: "Yes it is. Do you know where we're located?"
A: "Yeah. I drove by this morning and I liked the location. What's the rent?"
B: "It's $850 a month. So you would pay $425 a month plus half of the bills."
A: "How big is the place?"
B: "It's a two bedroom, one bath and roughly about 800 square feet."
A: "Is the complex pretty quiet? Can you hear a lot of noise or anything like that?"
B: "They have a strict policy in the apartment complex concerning noise level. So it stays very quiet after 10 PM."
A: "Are you the only person who lives there now?"
B: "Yeah. I'm only looking for one roommate."
A: "Everything sounds good. Can we schedule a time to meet so I can look at the place?"
B: "I'm available anytime today or tomorrow."
A: "How about if I come over now?"
B: "That works with me. But what is your name?"
A: "Oh, my name is Brad."
B: "Ok. I'm Randy. So I'll see you in a bit?"
A: "Should only take about 15 minutes to get there."
B: "Sounds good."
