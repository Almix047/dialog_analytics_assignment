E: "Hey John. I didn't know you were coming to this school."
B: "Yeah, what a coincidence. It's good to see you."
E: "It's been a while hasn't it?"
B: "What have you been up to?"
E: "Not much. Just school and stuff."
B: "Where are you going now?"
E: "I'm going to the registration building to see if I can withdrawal from one of my classes."
B: "Are you bombing the class or something?"
E: "Partially that, but mostly it's a boring class and I am getting nothing out of it."
B: "Where are you off to?"
E: "I finished class for today so I am meeting my girlfriend to watch a movie?"
B: "What are you watching?"
E: "The Lord of the Rings. I haven't seen it yet. Have you?"
B: "Yeah, I saw that about a month ago. It was really good."
E: "Don't tell me anything about it. I don't want to ruin the surprise."
B: "No problem. Hey, what are you doing this weekend?"
E: "Nothing really. I was going to rent a video and just hang out at home."
B: "My fraternity is going to have a party on Saturday night. Wanna come?"
E: "Hey, that sounds like fun. What fraternity are you in?"
B: "I'm over at the Delta Fraternity house."
E: "Cool. Give me your number and I'll call you Saturday."
B: "It's 206-555-1212."
E: "Aright. I'll see you on Saturday."
B: "See you later."
