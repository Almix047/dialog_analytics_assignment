A: "What did Mike get you for your birthday Pam?"
K: "He got me a watch. See."
A: "That's beautiful. He must have spent a fortune on it."
K: "He's so great. I think he might propose pretty soon."
A: "How do you know? Did he give you any clues?"
K: "He took me to a jewelry store and asked me what type of rings I like. It was a little obvious, but at least I got to pick the one I wanted."
A: "That's not so romantic?"
K: "He was never romantic. Silly and cute, but not romantic. I like all his quirkiness. He always makes me laugh."
A: "I guess you can't ask for much more than that."
K: "How is it going with you and Brad?"
A: "We broke up a week ago."
K: "I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
A: "I think we both just started to grow apart. I wasn't surprised."
K: "Are you doing ok?"
A: "Actually, I'm feeling great. I guess I needed some freedom."
K: "Have you started seeing other guys yet?"
A: "Not yet, but I when I meet a decent guy, I wouldn't mind dating again."
K: "What kind of guy are you looking for?"
A: "Although my relationship with Brad wasn't that bad, I want a guy who likes to go out more. Brad always spent all his time studying and researching for school. It was quite boring."
K: "You definitely need a guy who likes to have fun."
A: "I wouldn't mind dating a romantic guy. Maybe I'm dreaming, but a nice walk down the beach, or dancing in the moonlight would be something I would love to do."
K: "Hey. There are guys like that. All you have to do is find the right one."
A: "But that's the hard part. I always fall for the guy who is smart. And then after a couple of months, I get bored."
K: "Doesn't a tall, good looking guy turn you on?"
A: "Not really. What should I do?"
K: "We should go to a club this Saturday and find a smart romantic guy. How does that sound?"
A: "That sounds like a plan. Let's do it."
K: "Great. I'll see you at nine then."
A: "Ok. See you later."
