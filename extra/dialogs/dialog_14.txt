A: "Wow Billy. Looks like you lost a lot of weight. I could hardly recognize you."
O: "Thanks. I've been on a diet for about 6 months. I'm going to ask Rachel to marry me soon and I want to be mentally and physically healthy."
A: "What does being overweight have anything to do with marriage? If you love each other, that's enough right?"
O: "Yeah, but I want to show her how much she means to me, and this is one way of proving it. I am changing for the better."
A: "Good for you. Hey, when do you plan on proposing to her?"
O: "I think I am going to propose to her on our 2 year anniversary."
A: "Is she expecting it, or will it be a surprise?"
O: "I think she expects me to ask her one of these days, but not anytime soon."
A: "You sure you want to settle down already? You're only 25 years old?"
O: "Yeah, I didn't think I would get married until I was 30, but when you know she is the one, why wait."
A: "That's true. Hey, I hope everything works out. You're going to invite me to your wedding right?"
O: "Of course man."
A: "Gosh, I'm still shocked how much weight you lost. You're getting real skinny now."
O: "I am working on a six pack now. I have two lines starting to show up. I've been spending a lot of time at the gym. It is hard work, but I feel so good after working out."
A: "Where do you work out?"
O: "I have a membership at Bally's. It's not too expensive and I like all the equipment they have."
A: "I've been thinking about joining a gym. Are they having any specials right now?"
O: "Yeah, they do. They have free enrollment and first month free. You should come by. I'll show you around. I can take in a guest so you can try it out before signing up."
A: "That sounds good. Let's go this Saturday."
O: "Cool. I'll call you in the morning."
